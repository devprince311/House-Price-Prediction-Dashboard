# House-Price-Prediction-Dashboard
Performed data-driven housing price analysis during my internship by cleaning and preprocessing a
dataset of 1,000+ real estate listings, conducting exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, and
evaluating multiple regression models using RMSE and R². This analysis revealed living area and property
grade as the strongest price drivers, diminishing returns beyond 3–4 bedrooms, and consistent price
premiums for properties with view and waterfront features.
